This Python program implements a grading system using `if` and `elif` statements. It takes a student's score as input and prints the corresponding grade based on the following scale:

- 70–100: Grade A
- 60–69: Grade B
- 50–59: Grade C
- 45–49: Grade D
- 40–44: Grade E
- 20–39: Grade F

For each valid score, the program also prints "YES" to confirm the grading was successful. If the score is outside the valid range, it prints "Invalid score" and "NO".
